# Java---Less-is-More-Game
# üöÄ A Mathematics Game written in Java 

Welcome reader, this is a cool project which I have made that has a lot of cool features! 
Numbers on the buttons are set to a random digit between 1 and 9.
‚Ä¢ The target value is displayed above the field.
‚Ä¢ The current sum of numbers on the buttons is displayed below the field.
‚Ä¢ The number of moves until the end of the game is displayed in the top right corner
above the field

# üéØ Game Objective:
# The goal of the game is to select buttons on a grid so that the sum of their values gets as close as possible to a given target value.
When you press a given button, you can not press the same button again, the value of the button pressed gives you all the rows divisible by that number.
The second time you press a button it switches! You can choose all the intersections between all the rows divisible by the value of the 2nd button you pressed and the columns of the previous value! 

# üõ†Ô∏è Tasks:
‚Ä¢ Dynamic Field Layout: The game generates a new field layout for each session, with a default grid size of 10 √ó 10.
‚Ä¢ Save & Load Field Layout: Players can save the current game field to a file and load previously saved layouts for future play.
‚Ä¢ Game Control Menu: A versatile game menu allows players to restart the game, set a custom field size, define the number of moves, and set the target value.
‚Ä¢ Difficulty Settings: The game offers difficulty options‚Äîeasy, medium, and hard‚Äîthat adjust the target value and number of moves.
‚Ä¢ Solution Quality Display: When the move counter reaches zero, the graphical interface will display the deviation from the target value.
‚Ä¢ Game Continuation Detection: The game detects when no further moves are possible.
